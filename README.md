## 🌟 Introduction

The **Boat Service Management System** is designed to digitize manual record-keeping for marine service centers. It allows administrators to manage service requests, track boat repairs, handle inventory, and generate billing reports efficiently.

This project was built to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## 🚀 Key Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure login for Admins and Staff.
* **Service Management:** Create, update, and track service/repair jobs.
* **Inventory Control:** Manage spare parts and stock levels.
* **Customer Database:** Maintain records of boat owners and service history.
* **Billing & Invoicing:** Generate invoices for completed services.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and tablet views.
